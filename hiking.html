    <h3 id="mainText"><b>Eagles Rock</b></h3>
    <p id="mainText"> 
    Eagles Rock in Glenade, County Leitrim is 
    Ireland’s highest freestanding tower. Its peak is 330 metres above sea level and can be viewed for 
    many miles in all directions. This limestone tower stands free of the surrounding 
    vertical limestone Croontypruglish cliffs by an 80-metre gap. Access to the base of the tower is by 
    a steep scrambling traverse from the roadside car park and information board. Follow the right of way out 
    of the car park over the stile, take this good path up onto the mountainside at about 200-metre contour. 
    From here it is a steep contour south-east to the landward col at the base of Eagles Rock.
    Eagles Rock has only been climbed twice, its first ascent was in 1971 and in 2012.<br>

    <h3 id="mainText"><b>Arro Mountain</b></h3>
    <p id="mainText"> 
    Enjoy a breathtaking walk in Glenade, 
    with stunning mountain views of Keelogeyboy, and Truskmore and out to Mullaghmore Head. This hike 
    takes minor road and bog road to the base of the hills before climbing along the southern flank of a river valley 
    below Arroo Mountain. Then crosses over heathery terrain to reach the summit. The hike continues along to reach 
    lovely lough Arroo and then crosses the plateau to the much sought after Keelogues Lakes known as "Tin Whistle Lake". 
    There is a lovely white sandy beach at one end and you can even take a swim or sit and enjoy one of the most 
    beautiful spots in Leitrim.

    <h3 id="mainText"><b>Gleniff Horseshoe</b></h3>
    <p id="mainText">
    The Gleniff Horseshoe is a fabulous glacial valley in the north side of Dartry mountains. 
    High up in the cliffs of Annacoona in the Gleniff Horseshoe valley lies the legendary cave of Diarmuid and Grainne.
    The arched cave is the highest in Ireland and it’s a place rooted in folklore and romance.
    The legend has it that the eloping couple on the run from the jealous Chief Fionn MacCool who had planned 
    to take Grainne for his wife, hid in the cave to avoid being captured. The forbidden lovers were said to 
    have spent their last night in this cave before Diarmuid was killed by the Wild Boar of Benbulben and 
    before heartbroken Grainne took her own life.
